# RushForWords
A Node JS multiplayer word game.

This application primarily uses socket.io

This is an old project that I made for fun back in high school.

Unimplemented Features:
- Player Functionality
- Stop sending client all valid words and have a worker node detect if the current letters is a valid word.
- Server Side Validation
