# RushForWords
A Node JS multiplayer word game.

This application primarily uses socket.io

This is an old project that I made for fun back in high school.

Unimplemented Features:
- Single-Player Functionality
- Client-side validation of input words. (Currently using a reduced list from the server)
- Server Side Validation
